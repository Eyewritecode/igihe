# What is it?
This is a small web scrapper for comments on [igihe.com](www.igihe.com) articles.

I realized, from the article title, you can get what the whole story is about without spending too much time reading through it.
Most of the time what you do is scroll through the page to the comments section and start reading :)

So i thought, why can't i make it simpler and faster...

# How to run it?
You need to have ruby installed on your computer and make sure all the required gems are installed.
> gem install nokogiri

when you're done, in your terminal run:
> ruby igihe.rb categoryname

you can replace **category name** with any category available on [igihe.](www.igihe.com)

the rest is self explanatory ;)
